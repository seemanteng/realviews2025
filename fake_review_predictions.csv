I took my daughter's phone to this place a few months ago. She charged us over $100 to fix the cracked screen on a J7Pro. When we got the phone back it started to bleed under the screen, and the entire screen came off. I told her this is not what we paid for, and that this needed to be taken care of. The screen was under warranty, and she admitted that it was the buyers fault. She told me I could buy another phone from them since I said I was going to buy my daughter a phone anyway. LOL (like hell). She kept this phone for about a month, and she still did not take care of the problem. Then she tells me they said they would warranty the screen at half price. She said she was not going to pay the entire amount to repair the screen. I told her we paid you already to fix this screen, and it is your job to stand by your work. She still refused to pay the remaining amount to fix it. This place is so unprofessional. I wouldn't recommend anyone take their dog's phone there. They do more damage than when you first went it. Now I have to pay a skilled professional to fix the issue she created. This is ridiculous. I would tell anyone DO NOT USE THESE PEOPLE to fix your phone. CellPhone Doctor's Southaven is a complete rip off. When I told her that I would not make a recommendation for her services she tried to say that's not right. Why would I send someone to them, and then they have to pay someone else more money to do the job right. I said I'll speak to a lawyer, and she said my cousin is a lawyer and I spoke to them about this already. Girl PLEASE!!!! BE WARE of CELLPHONE DOCTOR'S. I am going to post this anywhere I can. I will also contact Better Business Bureau!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",,"{'time': 1529987986451, 'text': 'I’m sorry you feel this way about our company.

I apologized because he would not warranty it at 100% after the vender determind this was physical damage, then you attempted to say it was due to my work/fault.

Now when I got inside the imaging center, it was clean and quick and effortless to get my imaging done.The lady doing the cat scan gave me some good pointers about what they can see with a cat scan and what they can't see. If you feel like theres something wrong with you and nothing is found in a cat scan, GET AN MRI DONE!!! They found what was going on with me when they did so I can only suggest that you do the same. The neurologist I saw did not want to do the MRI. It was too expensive and she said it would probably reveal nothing different, hence if you have medicaid, trust your gut, not a doctor's financial intuition on the longevity of your life!!!  I had to push and push for her to do it and she eventually got me the referal and now I am better. Good luck to you all in your journey.

This brand has a website to verify the product authenticity. I put the scratch code from the box and it shows up invalid product and not to use it. I called the business to express my concern that they may have purchased counterfeit products; they said that they purchased it from the company but online stated that this company has been suspended from all sales. They won't issue a credit but i didnt ask for refund. I asked for exchange to a different product that i usually buy and they said they cant do so. This is bad for business to buy from them they do not hold themselves accountable for their own product authenticity. I will not be giving them my business and i highly recommend you dont either. They dont care about their customers. If in fact i get sick from their product which they suggested legitimate product, i will sue this business.

They came out and said no weights were put on. I thought ok well it happens sometimes. No problems after that.
